# Data Structures Practice

This repo is for practicing the implementation of data structures and sorting algorithms. For now, 
this readme will only have a todo list since I don't know what I'll be adding.


## TODO

- Things to add:
    - Searches (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Search_algorithms)
        - BFS and DFS
        - Dijkstras
        - Binary Search
        - A*
        - Best first search
        - Greedy Algorithms
            - Ford Fulkerson
            - Kruskals
            - Prims
    - Sorting
        - Heapsort
        - Mergesort
        - Quicksort
        - Tree sort
        - Insertion Sort
    - Trees
        - Black/Red Trees
        - Heaps
            - Fibonacci heap
            - Binary Heap
        - AVL Tree
        - B-Tree
        - R-Tree
        - Trie
    - Hash Tables
    - Stacks and Queues
    - Graphs
    - Memoization and Dynamic Programming
    - Graph visualization
- Add descriptions to pages to describe what each one does.
- Nice to have:
    - Visualization maybe even 3D
    - Explore non-greedy algorithms
